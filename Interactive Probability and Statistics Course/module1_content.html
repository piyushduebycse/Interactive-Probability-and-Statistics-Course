        <h2>1.1 Introduction to Probability</h2>
        <p>Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of randomness and uncertainty. It provides a framework for modeling and analyzing random phenomena, making it an essential tool in various fields such as statistics, science, engineering, finance, and everyday decision-making.</p>
        
        <p>The concept of probability emerged from the study of games of chance in the 17th century. Mathematicians like Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat developed the early foundations of probability theory while analyzing gambling problems. Today, probability theory has evolved into a sophisticated mathematical discipline with applications far beyond its origins.</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>What is Probability?</h3>
            <p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A probability of 0 indicates impossibility (the event will not occur)</li>
                <li>A probability of 1 indicates certainty (the event will occur)</li>
                <li>A probability between 0 and 1 indicates the degree of likelihood (higher values indicate more likely events)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>There are three main interpretations of probability:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Classical (theoretical) probability:</strong> Based on equally likely outcomes. If an experiment has n equally likely outcomes and m of these outcomes correspond to event A, then P(A) = m/n.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative frequency (empirical) probability:</strong> Based on the observed frequency of an event. If an experiment is repeated N times and event A occurs m times, then P(A) ≈ m/N as N becomes very large.</li>
            <li><strong>Subjective probability:</strong> Based on personal judgment or belief about the likelihood of an event, often used when classical or frequency approaches are not applicable.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Different Probability Approaches</h3>
            <p><strong>Classical approach:</strong> When rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a 3 is 1/6 because there are six equally likely outcomes, and only one of them is a 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Frequency approach:</strong> If you roll a die 600 times and observe that a 3 appears 98 times, the empirical probability would be 98/600 ≈ 0.163.</p>
            <p><strong>Subjective approach:</strong> A weather forecaster might say there's a 70% chance of rain tomorrow based on their expertise and analysis of weather patterns.</p>

        <h2>1.2 Sample Spaces, Events, and Outcomes</h2>
        
        <p>To formalize probability, we need to define some fundamental concepts:</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Sample Space</h3>
            <p>The sample space (denoted by S or Ω) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each outcome in the sample space is a complete, detailed result of the experiment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Event</h3>
            <p>An event is a subset of the sample space, representing a collection of outcomes. Events are typically denoted by capital letters (A, B, C, etc.).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>An outcome is a single result of an experiment. It is an element of the sample space.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Rolling a Die</h3>
            <p><strong>Sample space:</strong> S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>
            <p><strong>Event A:</strong> Getting an even number = {2, 4, 6}</p>
            <p><strong>Event B:</strong> Getting a number greater than 4 = {5, 6}</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Rolling a 3 is a single outcome in the sample space</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Events can be combined using set operations:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Union (A ∪ B):</strong> The event that either A or B (or both) occur</li>
            <li><strong>Intersection (A ∩ B):</strong> The event that both A and B occur</li>
            <li><strong>Complement (A'):</strong> The event that A does not occur</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Set Operations with Events</h3>
            <p>Using the die example above:</p>
            <p><strong>A ∪ B:</strong> Getting an even number or a number greater than 4 = {2, 4, 5, 6}</p>
            <p><strong>A ∩ B:</strong> Getting an even number greater than 4 = {6}</p>
            <p><strong>A':</strong> Not getting an even number = {1, 3, 5}</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>1.3 Probability Axioms and Rules</h2>
        
        <p>Probability theory is built on three fundamental axioms, proposed by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933:</p>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <p><strong>Axiom 1:</strong> For any event A, P(A) ≥ 0</p>
            <p><strong>Axiom 2:</strong> P(S) = 1, where S is the sample space</p>
            <p><strong>Axiom 3:</strong> For mutually exclusive events A₁, A₂, A₃, ..., P(A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ ...) = P(A₁) + P(A₂) + P(A₃) + ...</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>From these axioms, we can derive several important probability rules:</p>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <p><strong>Complement Rule:</strong> P(A') = 1 - P(A)</p>
            <p><strong>Addition Rule:</strong> P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</p>
            <p><strong>Multiplication Rule:</strong> P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = P(B) × P(A|B)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Applying Probability Rules</h3>
            <p>In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing either a heart or a face card?</p>
            <p>Let A = drawing a heart, and B = drawing a face card.</p>
            <p>P(A) = 13/52 = 1/4 (there are 13 hearts in a deck)</p>
            <p>P(B) = 12/52 = 3/13 (there are 12 face cards: jacks, queens, and kings)</p>
            <p>P(A ∩ B) = 3/52 (there are 3 face cards that are hearts: jack, queen, and king of hearts)</p>
            <p>Using the addition rule: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 1/4 + 3/13 - 3/52 = 13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52 = 22/52 = 11/26</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>1.4 Conditional Probability and Independence</h2>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
            <p>Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), read as "the probability of A given B."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <p><strong>Conditional Probability Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) > 0</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Conditional Probability</h3>
            <p>In a class of 30 students, 18 are taking mathematics, 15 are taking physics, and 10 are taking both subjects.</p>
            <p>If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that the student is taking mathematics given that they are taking physics?</p>
            <p>Let M = student takes mathematics, and P = student takes physics.</p>
            <p>We want to find P(M|P).</p>
            <p>P(M ∩ P) = 10/30 = 1/3 (probability of taking both subjects)</p>
            <p>P(P) = 15/30 = 1/2 (probability of taking physics)</p>
            <p>P(M|P) = P(M ∩ P) / P(P) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3</p>
            <p>So, the probability that a student takes mathematics given that they take physics is 2/3.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p>Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, A and B are independent if and only if:</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="formula">
            <p><strong>Independence Condition:</strong></p>
            <p>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)</p>
            <p>Equivalently, P(A|B) = P(A) or P(B|A) = P(B)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Independence</h3>
            <p>When flipping a fair coin twice, let A = getting heads on the first flip, and B = getting heads on the second flip.</p>
            <p>P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/2</p>
            <p>P(A ∩ B) = 1/4 (probability of getting heads on both flips)</p>
            <p>Since P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, events A and B are independent.</p>

        <h2>1.5 Bayes' Theorem</h2>
        
        <p>Bayes' theorem provides a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. It is a fundamental result in probability theory with wide-ranging applications.</p>
